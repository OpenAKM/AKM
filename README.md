## AKM Top Level Repository
- This folder will contain the build scripts to create the complete AKM Project
- There are several AKM repositories that are maintained and built separately to provide the complete AKM solution

## What is AKM?
Autonomous Key Management
- AKM is both a Decentralized, Distributed, Ledger-Based, Key Management System (KMS) and Multi-point communication security protocol layer
- AKM can naturally act as a drop-in replacement for PKI + TLS
- AKM uses a Broadcast Architecture that supports end-to-end encryption

## Future Vison
- AKM will be the preferred standard for IoT Security, particularly in Industrial IoT, Smart City, Smart Home/Office, and Smart Factory environments
- AKM will become part of the RFC set of protocols, replacing TLS as the preferred security transport protocol
- AKM will be the preferred method to secure groups of nodes on the battlefield and in remote areas like space and underwater (both of which are difficult to update security credentials using PKI).

## Current Status
- While AKM has been in the works for quite a while, this GitHub Open Source effort is just staring as of January 2025.
- We are in the initial stages of the project. No projuct or source code has been released.

## Contributing
